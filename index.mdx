## Welcome to the Sodex API

The Sodex API provides powerful tools for managing projects, uploading point cloud data, and retrieving measurements from the Sodex platform. This documentation will guide you through everything you need to know to successfully integrate with our API.

## Quick Start

New to the Sodex API? Start here to understand the fundamentals:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Getting Started" icon="rocket" href="/pages/getting-started">
    Learn about API structure, authentication, and the project-centric design. Essential reading for all developers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Authentication" icon="shield-halved" href="/pages/auth/overview">
    Understand authentication methods, OAuth flows, and security best practices.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Core Workflows

Once you understand the basics, explore these key workflows:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Snapshot Upload" icon="cloud-arrow-up" href="/pages/snapshots/overview">
    Upload point cloud data through a structured workflow - from project selection to S3 upload and commit.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Measurements Retrieval" icon="chart-line" href="/pages/measurements/overview">
    Access measurement data using three flexible approaches: organization-wide, project-specific, or layer-based.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Key Concepts

Understanding these fundamental concepts will help you work effectively with the Sodex API:

### Project-Centric Architecture

Almost every operation in the Sodex API requires a project context. Projects are containers that organize your data and control access permissions.

- **Organizations** contain multiple projects
- **Projects** contain snapshots, measurements, and other data
- **Project IDs** are required for most API operations

### Consistent API Patterns

All endpoints follow the same patterns for:

- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication
- **Pagination**: `skip`, `limit`, `total_count` fields
- **Filtering**: Query syntax with operators like `=`, `>`, `*`
- **Sorting**: Field-based sorting with `+`/`-` prefixes

### Data Types

The platform handles several key data types:

- **Snapshots**: Point cloud data uploads with metadata
- **Measurements**: Sensor data organized by layers and projects
- **Projects**: Organizational containers for all data
- **Organizations**: Top-level groupings for users and projects

## Common Integration Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Real-time Monitoring">
    Build dashboards that monitor current data across your organization using organization-level measurement endpoints with recent timestamp filtering.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Project-Specific Applications">
    Create applications focused on specific projects by using project-scoped endpoints for both data upload and retrieval.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Integration">
    Extract measurement data for external analysis using layer-based access for specific data types and efficient pagination.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Important Notes

<Warning>
**Pagination Awareness**: All list endpoints return a maximum of 200 items by default. Always check `total_count` vs `count` to ensure you're not missing data. Implement pagination for complete data retrieval.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Integration-Specific Endpoints**: Some workflows (like snapshot uploads) may receive dedicated, customized endpoints for specific integrations. Contact Sodex directly for integration-specific requirements.
