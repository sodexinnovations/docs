## Welcome to the Sodex API

This guide will walk you through the essential concepts and first steps needed to successfully integrate with the Sodex API. You'll learn about the project-centric architecture and how to navigate the API structure.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Valid authentication credentials (see [Authentication Guide](/pages/auth/overview))
- Access to at least one organization and project
- A basic understanding of REST APIs and HTTP requests

## Understanding the API Structure

The Sodex API is built around a **project-centric architecture**. Almost all operations require a project context, making the `project_id` one of the most important parameters you'll work with.

### Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Organizations">
    Organizations are the top-level containers in the Sodex ecosystem. Every user belongs to exactly one organization and organizations contain projects.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Projects">
    Projects are the primary workspace units where all data and operations are organized. Most API endpoints require a `project_id` parameter to specify which project context you're working in.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Object IDs">
    All resources in the Sodex API use MongoDB ObjectIDs - 24-character hexadecimal strings (e.g., `507f1f77bcf86cd799439011`). These IDs are globally unique and immutable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 1: Get Your Organization

Start by fetching information about your current organization. This helps you understand your organizational context and available resources.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.sodex.cloud/v2/organizations/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.sodex.cloud/v2/organizations/me',
    headers=headers
)

organization = response.json()
print(f"Organization: {organization['data']['name']}")
print(f"Organization ID: {organization['data']['id']}")
```
</CodeGroup>

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    "name": "Acme Construction Ltd",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T09:30:00Z",
    "settings": {
      "timezone": "Europe/Berlin"
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
For complete API reference including request/response schemas, see the [Get Current Organization](/api-reference/organizations/get-current-organization) endpoint in the API documentation.
</Note>

## Step 2: Fetch Your Projects

Next, retrieve all projects you have access to within your organization. This is crucial because you'll need a `project_id` for most subsequent API operations.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.sodex.cloud/v2/organizations/me/projects" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```python Python
response = requests.get(
    'https://api.sodex.cloud/v2/organizations/me/projects',
    headers=headers
)

projects = response.json()

print("Available Projects:")
for project in projects['data']:
    print(f"- {project['name']} (ID: {project['id']})")

# Store the first project ID for later use
if projects['data']:
    project_id = projects['data'][0]['id']
    print(f"\nUsing project ID: {project_id}")
```
</CodeGroup>

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439022",
      "name": "Downtown Construction Project",
      "description": "Main construction site monitoring",
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
      "status": "active"
    },
    {
      "id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439033",
      "name": "Infrastructure Survey",
      "description": "Quarterly infrastructure assessment",
      "created_at": "2024-02-01T14:30:00Z",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "total": 2
  }
}
```

<Note>
For complete API reference including request/response schemas, see the [Get All Projects in My Organization](/api-reference/projects/get-all-projects-in-my-organization) endpoint in the API documentation.

## Understanding IDs and Their Importance

### MongoDB ObjectIDs

All resource identifiers in the Sodex API are MongoDB ObjectIDs with these characteristics:

- **Format**: 24-character hexadecimal string
- **Example**: `507f1f77bcf86cd799439011`
- **Uniqueness**: Globally unique across the entire system
- **Immutability**: Never change once assigned

### The Critical Role of `project_id`

The `project_id` is the most important parameter in the Sodex API because:

1. **Context Provider**: It tells the API which project you're working with
2. **Access Control**: Ensures you can only access data you have permissions for
3. **Data Isolation**: Keeps project data separate and organized
4. **Required Parameter**: Most endpoints require it in the URL path

## Project-Centric API Design

Almost everything in the Sodex API is **project-referenced**. Here's why this matters:

### Examples of Project-Centric Endpoints

```http
# Get snapshots for a specific project
GET /v2/projects/{project_id}/snapshots-v2

# Create a snapshot in a specific project
POST /v2/projects/{project_id}/snapshots

# Get project-specific data
GET /v2/projects/{project_id}/data

# Access project settings
GET /v2/projects/{project_id}/settings
```

### Why Project Context Matters

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data Organization">
    All snapshots, scans, and related data are organized within projects. Without a project context, the API doesn't know which dataset you want to work with.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Permission Management">
    Your access to data is controlled at the project level. The `project_id` ensures you can only access projects you're a member of.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resource Isolation">
    Projects provide clear boundaries between different workflows, teams, and datasets.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Billing and Analytics">
    Usage tracking and billing are often organized by project, making the project context essential for these operations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Practical Example: Complete Workflow

Here's a complete example showing how to use the organization and project information:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import requests

# Setup
headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
base_url = 'https://api.sodex.cloud/v2'

# Step 1: Get organization info
org_response = requests.get(f'{base_url}/organizations/me', headers=headers)
organization = org_response.json()['data']
print(f"Working with organization: {organization['name']}")

# Step 2: Get available projects
projects_response = requests.get(f'{base_url}/organizations/me/projects', headers=headers)
projects = projects_response.json()['data']

if not projects:
    print("No projects available. Contact your administrator.")
    exit()

# Step 3: Select a project (use first available)
selected_project = projects[0]
project_id = selected_project['id']
print(f"Selected project: {selected_project['name']} (ID: {project_id})")

# Step 4: Now you can make project-specific API calls
snapshots_response = requests.get(
    f'{base_url}/projects/{project_id}/snapshots-v2', 
    headers=headers
)
snapshots = snapshots_response.json()
print(f"Found {len(snapshots.get('data', []))} snapshots in this project")

# The project_id is now your key to accessing all project-related data
```

```javascript JavaScript
const baseUrl = 'https://api.sodex.cloud/v2';
const headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};

async function getStarted() {
  try {
    // Step 1: Get organization
    const orgResponse = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/organizations/me`, { headers });
    const organization = await orgResponse.json();
    console.log(`Organization: ${organization.data.name}`);

    // Step 2: Get projects
    const projectsResponse = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/organizations/me/projects`, { headers });
    const projects = await projectsResponse.json();
    
    if (projects.data.length === 0) {
      throw new Error('No projects available');
    }

    // Step 3: Select project
    const projectId = projects.data[0].id;
    console.log(`Using project: ${projects.data[0].name} (${projectId})`);

    // Step 4: Make project-specific calls
    const snapshotsResponse = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/projects/${projectId}/snapshots-v2`, { headers });
    const snapshots = await snapshotsResponse.json();
    console.log(`Found ${snapshots.data?.length || 0} snapshots`);

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error.message);
  }
}

getStarted();
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

1. **Always Store Project IDs**: Cache the project IDs you frequently work with to avoid repeated API calls
2. **Handle Multiple Projects**: If you have access to multiple projects, implement project selection in your application
3. **Validate Access**: Always check that API responses are successful before proceeding
4. **Use Descriptive Variables**: Store IDs in clearly named variables like `project_id`, `organization_id`
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for cases where you don't have access to expected resources

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

<Warning>
**Missing Project Context**: Don't forget that most endpoints require a `project_id`. If you get 404 errors, verify you're using the correct project ID and have access to that project.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Hardcoded IDs**: Avoid hardcoding project IDs in your application. Always fetch them dynamically as project access can change over time.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Wrong ID Format**: Ensure you're using the full 24-character ObjectID format. Shorter or longer strings will result in validation errors.
</Warning>

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics:

1. **Explore Authentication**: Learn about different authentication methods in the [Authentication Guide](/pages/auth/overview)
2. **Work with Snapshots**: Try the [Snapshot Upload Workflow](/pages/snapshots/overview) to upload point cloud data
3. **API Reference**: Browse the complete [API Reference](/api-reference) for detailed endpoint documentation
4. **Error Handling**: Familiarize yourself with common error scenarios and status codes

<Note>
Remember: When in doubt, start with getting your organization and projects. These two steps provide the foundation for all other API operations in the Sodex platform.
