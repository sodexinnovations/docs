description: "Secure authentication using OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for accessing Sodex APIs"
---

## Overview

Sodex provides a comprehensive OAuth 2.0 authentication system with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) support for secure client authorization. This implementation follows industry standards to ensure secure access to our APIs.

<Warning>
**Client Registration Required**: Before implementing OAuth 2.0 authentication, your application must be registered with Sodex to obtain the necessary `client_id` and `client_secret` credentials. Please contact [Sodex support](mailto:support@sodex-innovations.com) to register your application and receive your OAuth credentials.
</Warning>

## Base URL

All authentication requests are made to:

```
https://api.sodex.cloud
```

## Supported Features

The Sodex OAuth 2.0 implementation includes:

## Authentication Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register Your Application">
    Contact Sodex support to register your application and obtain client credentials
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorization Request">
    Redirect users to the authorization endpoint with required parameters
  </Step>
  <Step title="Token Exchange">
    Exchange the authorization code for access and refresh tokens
  </Step>
  <Step title="API Access">
    Use the access token to make authenticated API requests
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Features

### PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)

All authorization flows must implement PKCE for enhanced security:
- Prevents authorization code interception attacks
- Required for all client types (public and confidential)
- Supports both S256 and plain methods (S256 recommended)

### Token Security

- **Short-lived access tokens**: 8 hours in production, 5 minutes in development
- **Long-lived refresh tokens**: 30 days in production, 10 minutes in development
- **JWT format**: All tokens use signed JWT with HS256 algorithm
- **Secure storage**: Tokens should never be exposed in client-side code

## Available Scopes

### Application Scopes
Request these scopes during authorization:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `sdxapi` | Access to SDX API functionality |

### User Permission Scopes
These scopes are automatically assigned based on user permissions:

| Scope | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `user` | Basic user access |
| `guest` | Guest user access |
| `cloud_base` | Cloud base license |
| `mobile` | Mobile license |
| `organization_admin` | Organization administrator |
| `system_admin` | System administrator |

## Rate Limiting

OAuth endpoints are subject to rate limiting to ensure system stability:

- Implement exponential backoff for retry logic
- Respect `Retry-After` headers in error responses
- Monitor rate limit headers in responses
