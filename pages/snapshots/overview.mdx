<Warning>
**Third-Party Integration Notice:** This documentation describes the snapshot upload workflow specifically for third-party integrations that need to upload .laz files to the Sodex platform. Each integration partner will receive a unique integration prefix and dedicated API endpoints.
</Warning>

## Overview

The Snapshot Upload API provides a comprehensive workflow for third-party integrations to upload point cloud data (.laz files) to the platform. This system allows integration partners to manage projects and create snapshots containing point cloud data through a structured, multi-step process.

## Base URL Pattern

**Production:** `https://api.sodex.cloud/{integration-prefix}`

<Note>
Each integration partner receives a unique prefix that is prepended to all API endpoints. This prefix will be provided by Sodex when setting up your integration partnership.
</Note>

## Interactive API Documentation

<Warning>
**Integration-Specific Documentation:** The interactive API documentation and testing capabilities will be provided by Sodex for each integration partner with their specific endpoints and authentication details.
</Warning>

## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication. See the [Authentication section](/pages/auth/overview) for detailed information on how to authenticate your requests.

## Key Concepts

### Projects

Projects are containers that organize your snapshot data. You must be a member of a project to upload snapshots to it. The API supports cloud-only projects for snapshot uploads.

### Snapshots

Snapshots represent individual point cloud captures within a project. Each snapshot contains:

- Metadata about the capture (name, location, timing)
- A LAZ file containing the actual point cloud data
- Processing status information

## Workflow Overview

The snapshot upload process follows these main steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Projects">
    Retrieve all projects that you have access to within your organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Snapshot">
    Create a new snapshot record in the selected project with metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Upload Credentials">
    Obtain temporary S3 credentials for uploading your point cloud data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Data">
    Upload your LAZ file to S3 using the provided credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit Snapshot">
    Finalize the snapshot by providing the S3 key of your uploaded file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported File Formats

- **LAZ files**: Compressed LAS format for point cloud data

## Data Requirements

### Location Information

Snapshots can include optional location data:
- Latitude and longitude coordinates
- UTM zone number (1-60)
- UTM hemisphere (N or S)

If location data is not provided, it will be calculated automatically by the system.

### Timing Information

You can optionally provide:
- Start capture timestamp
- End capture timestamp

All timestamps should be provided in UTC timezone using ISO 8601 format.
