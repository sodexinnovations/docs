<Warning>
**Important Disclaimer:** This documentation describes the conceptual workflow for snapshot uploads. For actual implementations, each integration will receive dedicated endpoints and customized workflows. Please contact Sodex directly to discuss your specific integration requirements and obtain the appropriate API endpoints for your use case.
</Warning>

## Overview

The Snapshot Upload API provides a comprehensive workflow for uploading point cloud data to the platform. This system allows you to manage projects and create snapshots containing point cloud data through a structured, multi-step process.

## Base URL

**Production:** `https://api.sodex.cloud`

## Interactive API Documentation

Complete API documentation with interactive examples is available at: `https://api.sodex.cloud/docs`

## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication. See the [Authentication section](/pages/auth/overview) for detailed information on how to authenticate your requests.

## Key Concepts

### Projects

Projects are containers that organize your snapshot data. You must be a member of a project to upload snapshots to it. The API supports cloud-only projects for snapshot uploads.

### Snapshots

Snapshots represent individual point cloud captures within a project. Each snapshot contains:

- Metadata about the capture (name, location, timing)
- A LAZ file containing the actual point cloud data
- Processing status information

## Workflow Overview

The snapshot upload process follows these main steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Projects">
    Retrieve all projects that you have access to within your organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Snapshot">
    Create a new snapshot record in the selected project with metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Upload Credentials">
    Obtain temporary S3 credentials for uploading your point cloud data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Data">
    Upload your LAZ file to S3 using the provided credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit Snapshot">
    Finalize the snapshot by providing the S3 key of your uploaded file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported File Formats

- **LAZ files**: Compressed LAS format for point cloud data

## Data Requirements

### Location Information

Snapshots can include optional location data:
- Latitude and longitude coordinates
- UTM zone number (1-60)
- UTM hemisphere (N or S)

If location data is not provided, it will be calculated automatically by the system.

### Timing Information

You can optionally provide:
- Start capture timestamp
- End capture timestamp

All timestamps should be provided in UTC timezone using ISO 8601 format.
